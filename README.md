# ncaab-data-and-dumb-scraper

This project is a quick and dirty way to grab the rosters and player statistics for men's college basketball on sports-reference.com (going back to the 2010-11 season) and saving the data into .csv files. I lost the first version of this which wrote the data right into a sqlite database but I will eventually getting around to doing that again here.

The file 'sports-reference' is a current version of the sqlite database through the 2021-22 season.
